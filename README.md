# travel_app

## Explanation:

App works on an emulator, but it doesn't quite work on a real device. I'm not sure if I'm continuing this project, because the main objective was to learn how to work with fragments and how to make a single activity application. In addition, I've learned a lot about SQLite databases in Android and how to optimize image rendering within the application using external libraries. In conclusion, I'd say this was a very educational project for me.
